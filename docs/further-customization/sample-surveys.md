# GRMS Sample Surveys
GRMS team prepared two sample survey types -- Homecare and Post-Disaster Relief Survey forms based on real scenarios collected from industry experts in the fields. The sample surveys metadata is provided as an optional installation to try the GRMS app with a very minimal pro-installation configuration
