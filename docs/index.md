# Grassroots Mobile Survey App
Welcome to the Grassroots Mobile Survey App Documentation site, a resource for nonprofit organizations interested in using the app and people interested in contributing to the project.

## Brief History

After working with nonprofits in Nepal, India, Cambodia and Ethiopia, founder Trish Perkins recognized a need for mobile field surveys that sync with Salesforce. After perusing the market, she realized that none of the paid solutions were affordable for her clients. She set out to assemble a team of developers and others interested in making this service available not only to her clients, but to others in the nonprofit community. 

## Project Vision

The Grassroots Mobile Survey App team believes that mobile technology is critically important for meeting the missions of many nonprofits worldwide. These nonprofits must have staff in the field to bring their services to those in need who are unable to come to a central office. In the case of service-based organizations, the nonprofit's constituents are often better served in their home environments. In the case of emergencies and disasters, the constituents must be served in the field.
