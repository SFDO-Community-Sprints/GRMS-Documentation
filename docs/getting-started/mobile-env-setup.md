# Editing Mobile Environment Setup

* [Install the Mobile App](#install-the-mobile-app)
* [Register the Heroku App in the Mobile App](#register-the-heroku-app-in-the-mobile-app)

## Install the Mobile App
The app is not yet available in Android or iOS app stores, but you can install it yourself on an Android device with a little effort or on an iPhone/iPad with---we'll be honest---a lot of effort, for now.
### For Android users
Go to the [Release page](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/GrassRootsMobileSurveyApp/releases) with your mobile phone. Expand the **Assets** section of the latest version and download the `.apk` file. Then install it on your Android device.

### For iOS users
If you're a contributor in Salesforce.org Community Sprint, you can install our app via TestFlight. Contact the sprint leaders.

## Register the Heroku App in the Mobile App
With the app open in your mobile device,
tap the gear icon on the top right of the login screen. Then enter the [name of your Heroku app](./Heroku-Initial-Setup#deploy-the-heroku-app).

Click the [Save] button. Now the mobile app is ready to use!
