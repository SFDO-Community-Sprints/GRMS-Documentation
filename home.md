Welcome to the Grassroots Mobile Survey App Documentation site, a resource for nonprofit organizations interested in using the app and people interested in contributing to the project.


If you are a **nonprofit**:<br>
Your Salesforce Administrator just needs to do the [Getting Started](docs/getting-started/index.md) one-time setup before [Getting Your Field Workers Started](#getting-your-field-workers-started) with the mobile app. Then some [Further Customization](docs/further-customization/index.md) can make it more effective for you.

If you are an **aspiring contributor**:<br>
You can help us just by following the instructions in this wiki and giving us feedback about the process. Join our group discussion in the [Trailblazer Community group](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/ja/trailblazer-community/groups/0F94S000000kI60SAE). We also need [developers](docs/contribution/index.md) and help with documentation, marketing, and support.
